# Advent of Code #

My attempts at solving [Advent of Code] puzzles.

Life around the holiday time is usually quite busy making memories with my family. I don't aim to complete all of the puzzles, nor am I a speed coder. I enjoy writing software, so this is me doing something just for the fun of it.
